## FAQ / Troubleshooting
**Q: The UI isn't rendering correctly**

Check your default console appearance settings. Make sure your chosen font, font size, and line height aren't the cause of the problem. 'DejaVu Sans Mono' works well for me on Windows.

**Q: My images look squashed / stretched**

Try adjusting the value of Char Size Ratio under Settings > Size. Depending on what font your console uses, your characters may have a width-to-height ratio different than 0.5.

**Q: My exported .ansi files take up more space than the original image**

The ANSI code that produces the text-rendered images isn't (currently) optimized for file size. If using this tool to batch process lots of text art for use in a game or application, I'd consider compressing the resulting text files and decompressing them as needed.
